# 🚀 Java DSA Practice by Avdesh Jadon

Welcome to my personal Java Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice repository!  
This project is a **self-tracking journal** of my growth and hard work as I improve my problem-solving skills by tackling questions from **LeetCode** and other trusted sources.

> 📅 This repository is a long-term commitment to consistency, learning, and mastery.

---

## 📁 Structure

- Organized into **folders by topic** (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Trees, Recursion, etc.)
- Each folder contains:
  - Java solution files

---

## ✅ What's Inside

- ✅ Clean, well-structured Java code
- ✅ Ideal for students looking for clear Java DSA implementations
- ✅ Great way to track **how much effort and consistency** I’ve put into mastering problem-solving

---

## ✨ Why This Exists

As a student with a deep interest in software development, I created this repository to:

- 💪 Track my own DSA journey over time
- 🔍 Reflect on how much I've learned and how far I've come
- 🎯 Build a disciplined habit of solving problems daily
- 🧠 Eventually use this as a revision resource or portfolio for future opportunities

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java 21+
- VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA
- LeetCode as the primary source of questions
