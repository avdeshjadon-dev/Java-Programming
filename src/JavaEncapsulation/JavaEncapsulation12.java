// ------------------- 12. Encapsulation with Deposit and Withdraw -------------------
//
// Write a Java program to create a class called Account with private instance
// variables accountNumber, accountHolder, and balance. Provide public getter and
// setter methods to access and modify these variables. Add a method called deposit()
// that takes an amount and increases the balance by that amount, and a method called
// withdraw() that takes an amount and decreases the balance by that amount.
//
// ------------------- SAMPLE OUTPUT -------------------
// Account Number: 123456789
// Account Holder: Amrita
// Initial Balance: 1000.0
// After deposit of 500.0: 1500.0
// After withdrawal of 200.0: 1300.0
